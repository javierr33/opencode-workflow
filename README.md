## 🎓 How It Works

OpenCode Workflow has an intuitive structure to streamline your work. 

```
Your request ──► Orchestrator ──┬──► Code Reviewer    ──┐
                                ├──► Security Auditor ──┼──► Synthesized
                                ├──► Test Architect   ──┤    Report
                                └──► Debugger         ──┘
                                      (all parallel)
```

When you make a request, the Orchestrator directs it to the relevant agent. Each agent processes tasks independently, allowing for efficient project management.
